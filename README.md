- Standard C++ libraries
- No external dependencies required

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Compilation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd assembler
   ```

2. **Compile the source code**
   ```bash
   g++ -o assembler_with_pipeline assembler_with_pipeline.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the simulator**
   ```bash
   ./assembler_with_pipeline
   ```

## üéØ Usage

### Interactive Mode
1. Run the executable
2. Choose option 1 for manual input
3. Enter RISC-V assembly instructions one by one
4. Type 'end' to finish input and start simulation

### Default Test Mode
1. Run the executable
2. Choose option 2 to use built-in test instructions
3. Watch the pipeline simulation execute

### Example Assembly Code
```assembly
addi x7, x0, 8      # Load immediate value 8 into x7
beq x7, x0, 5       # Branch if x7 equals x0
addi x3, x0, 0      # Load immediate value 0 into x3
add x1, x2, x3      # Add x2 and x3, store in x1
sub x7, x7, x12     # Subtract x12 from x7
bge x7, x11, -4     # Branch if x7 >= x11
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Fetches instructions from instruction memory
- Updates Program Counter (PC)
- Handles pipeline stalls and flushes

#### 2. Instruction Decode (ID)
- Decodes instruction fields (opcode, funct3, funct7, registers, immediate)
- Reads register values
- Implements data forwarding logic
- Generates control signals

#### 3. Execute (EX)
- Performs ALU operations
- Handles branch and jump instructions
- Calculates memory addresses
- Manages control hazards

#### 4. Memory (MEM)
- Performs memory read/write operations
- Handles load/store instructions
- Passes ALU results to next stage

#### 5. Write Back (WB)
- Writes results back to register file
- Handles load-to-use forwarding

### Data Forwarding
The simulator implements data forwarding to resolve data hazards:
- **EX to EX forwarding**: Forwards ALU results from current EX stage to previous EX stage
- **MEM to EX forwarding**: Forwards memory data or ALU results from MEM stage to EX stage

### Control Hazards
- **Branch Instructions**: Flushes pipeline when branch is taken
- **Jump Instructions**: Flushes pipeline and updates PC
- **Pipeline Stalls**: Prevents instruction fetch during hazards

### ALU Operations
Supported ALU operations:
- `0000`: AND
- `0001`: OR
- `0010`: ADD
- `0011`: SLL (Shift Left Logical)
- `0100`: SRL (Shift Right Logical)
- `0101`: SRA (Shift Right Arithmetic)
- `0110`: SUB
- `0111`: SLT (Set Less Than)
- `1000`: SLTU (Set Less Than Unsigned)
- `11111`: XOR

## üìä Output Format

The simulator provides detailed output for each cycle:
- Current cycle number
- Stage-by-stage execution details
- Register values and memory operations
- Data forwarding information
- Pipeline flush and stall notifications
- Final register state

### Sample Output
